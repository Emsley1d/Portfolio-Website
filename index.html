                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

                    <h3>EXPERIENCE:</h3>
                    <p>I worked for EDF Energy for 15+ years in Back-Office Industry roles and specialised in the
                        process of both winning and losing supplies (please see my linkedIn for more details). I
                        experimented with Programming after leaving college however, never developed my interest any
                        further.</p>

                    <p>Seeking a new challenge and direction in life I started playing around with HTML, CSS and
                        JavaScript again at the start of 2022 and quickly found my interest and enjoyment doing so
                        to not have diminished over the years.
                    <p>I spent the first couple of months of the year teaching myself before taking a number of
                        courses on Codecademy. An opportunity presented itself in May which I grabbed with both
                        hands; I then started General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course in August.
                    </p>

                    <p>I have always enjoyed creating things and understanding how things worked. During my career
                        at EDF Energy I spent a lot of time writing and mapping processes during which I built a
                        desire to understand and appreciate how the systems I was working with came to operate. I
                        enjoyed pushing the systems as far as I could; establishing what was possible </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>INTERESTS:</h3>
                    <p>I'm a keen (albeit fair weather) cyclist; I ride both Cross-Country and Gravel.
                        I used to compete at an amateur level and am the proud owner of a number of KOMs (the
                        fastest time over a certain section) on Strava. I grew up riding the South Downs and am
                        currently exploring the Mendips and Strawberry line; having recently moved to Cheddar,
                        Somerset. Unfortunately, I am still recovering from a nasty crash in August (thank you
                        unsighted jump and tree!) so haven't been able to make the most of riding this year.</p>

                    <p>I'm an avid reader; I read each and every day without fail for an hour or so. It's my go to
                        way of relaxing, if i'm not in bed by 10 with a book then something has gone wrong! I try
                        to average a book a week and mainly read Thrillers or Science Fiction. Project Hail Mary by
                        Andy Weir is my current favourite and I would thoroughly recommend it!</p>

                    <p>I enjoy gaming and (having recently moved) use it as a means of socialising. I was brought up
                        on Nintendo games and still remain a fan; Animal Crossing New Horizons being my all-time
                        favourite. I also enjoy relaxing Indie games and am currently playing Dorf Romantik.</p>
