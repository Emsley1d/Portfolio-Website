                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

                    <h3>EXPERIENCE:</h3>
                    <p>I worked for EDF Energy for 15+ years in Back-Office Industry roles and specialised in the
                        process of both winning and losing supplies (please see my linkedIn for more details). I
                        experimented with Programming after leaving college however, never developed my interest any
                        further.</p>

                    <p>Seeking a new challenge and direction in life I started playing around with HTML, CSS and
                        JavaScript again at the start of 2022 and quickly found my interest and enjoyment doing so
                        to not have diminished over the years.
                    <p>I spent the first couple of months of the year teaching myself before taking a number of
                        courses on Codecademy. An opportunity presented itself in May which I grabbed with both
                        hands; I then started General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course in August.
                    </p>

                    <p>I have always enjoyed creating things and understanding how things worked. During my career
                        at EDF Energy I spent a lot of time writing and mapping processes; during which I built a
                        desire to understand and appreciate how the systems I was working with came to operate. I
                        enjoyed pushing the systems as far as I could; establishing exactly what was possible before they hit breaking point.
                        I believe this approach perfectly translates to a career in the Tech Industry. </p>

                    <p>&#x2022; I'm a keen cyclist; I ride both Cross-Country and Gravel.
                        I used to compete at an amateur level and am the proud owner of a number of KOMs (the
                        fastest time over a certain section) on Strava. I grew up riding the South Downs and am
                        currently exploring the Mendips; having recently moved to Cheddar,
                        Somerset. Unfortunately, I am still recovering from a nasty crash in August (thank you
                        unsighted jump and tree!) so haven't been able to make the most of riding this year.
                        My goal for 2023 is to complete my first century ride. </p>

                    <p>&#x2022; I'm an avid reader; I read each and every day without fail for an hour or so. It's my go to
                        way of relaxing, if I'm not in bed by 10 with a book then something has gone wrong! I try
                        to average a book a week and mainly read Thrillers or Science Fiction. Andy Weir is my favourite author. Ironically he was a Software Engineer for two decades prior to the success of The Martian.

                    <p>&#x2022; I enjoy gaming and (having recently moved) use it as a means of socialising. I was brought up
                        on Nintendo games and still remain a fan; Animal Crossing New Horizons being my all-time
                        favourite. I prefer small Indie games as opposed to triple A titles; they're far more interesting and intimate.
